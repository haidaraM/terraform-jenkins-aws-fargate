# Terraform Jenkins AWS ECS Fargate

Terraform stack to deploy Jenkins on ECS Fargate with Jenkins configuration stored in EFS and agents on Fargate. It can
be used as a starting point to build a production ready Jenkins on AWS.

More details can be found on [my blog post](https://blog.haidara.io/post/jenkins-aws-fargate/) (in French).

## How it works

It uses a docker image based on the [official Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker). See `docker/` folder.

The following main resources will be created:

- An application load balancer in front of Jenkins.
- A network load balancer for Agent -> Controller communication. For more information about how Controller <-> Agents
  communication works, see [this page](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds).
- An EFS to store Jenkins configuration.
- An S3 bucket used by the Jenkins Configuration as code plugin to get the configuration generated by Terraform.
- Two log groups for the Controller and agents logs

## Prerequisites

- A VPC with public and private subnets configured properly (route table, nat gateways...)
- An IAM user with the proper policies to run Terraform on the following services: EC2, ECS, IAM, S3, Cloudwatch, EFS,
  Route53 et ACM.
- A recent version of Terraform ( > 0.12.20)

The only required Terraform variables are:

- `vpc_id` : the VPC ID
- `public_subnets` : public subnets IDs
- `private_subnets` : private subnets IDs

See [variables.tf](./variables.tf) for all the possible variables to override.

AWS authentication:

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=...
# or
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
```

Deployment:

```bash
export TF_VAR_vpc_id="vpc-123456789"
export TF_VAR_private_subnets='["private-subnet-a", "private-subnet-b", "private-subnet-c"]'
export TF_VAR_public_subnets='["public-subnet-a", "public--subnet-b", "public-subnet-c"]'
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Get the default admin credentials and connect to the controller url in the output `jenkins_public_url`:

```shell
terraform output jenkins_credentials
```

The first time you access the controller, the `Getting started` guide will ask you to install the recommended plugins.
Install them and restart the controller.
