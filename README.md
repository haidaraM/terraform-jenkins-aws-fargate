# Terraform Jenkins AWS ECS Fargate
Terraform stack to deploy Jenkins on ECS Fargate with Jenkins configuration stored in EFS and agents on Fargate too. 
Since the recent support for EFS in Fargate, we can now run a fully Serverless Jenkins on AWS.

This stack can be used as a starting point to build a production ready Jenkins on AWS. 

More details can be found on [my blog post](https://blog.haidara.io/post/jenkins-aws-fargate/) (in french).

## How it works
This stack will deploy Jenkins Master on ECS Fargate. It uses a docker image based on the [official Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker). See `docker/` folder.

The following main resources will be created:
 - An application load balancer in front of Jenkins.
 - A network load balancer for Agent -> Master communication. For more information about how Master <-> Agents communication works, see [this page](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds).
 - An EFS to store Jenkins configuration.
 - An S3 bucket used by the Jenkins Configuration as code plugin to get the configuration generated by Terraform.
 - Two log groups for the Master and agents logs

## Prerequisites
 - A VPC with public and private subnets configured properly (route table, nat gateways...)
 - An IAM user with the proper policies to run Terraform on the following services: EC2, ECS, IAM, S3, Cloudwatch, EFS, Route53 et ACM.
 - A recent version of Terraform ( > 0.12.20)

The only required Terraform variables are:
 - `vpc_id` : the VPC ID
 - `public_subnets` : public subnets IDs
 - `private_subnets` : private subnets IDs

See [variables.tf](./variables.tf) for all the possible variables to override.

AWS authentication:
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=...
# or
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=""
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=""
```

Deployment:
```bash
export TF_VAR_vpc_id="vpc-123456789"
export TF_VAR_private_subnets='["private-subnet-a", "private-subnet-b", "private-subnet-c"]'
export TF_VAR_public_subnets='["public-subnet-a", "public--subnet-b", "public-subnet-c"]'
terraform init
terraform apply
```
